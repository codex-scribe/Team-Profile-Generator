# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This command-line application provides an easy way for users to create a webpage for their staff of employees.  Upon completion, a new html page is generated, displaying all the current employees and details about them.  The several roles available are Manager, Engineer, and Intern, with different details about each one.

## Instructions
To use the application, download the repository, and then run "npm i" in a terminal.  After installing the node packages, run the application by entering "node index.js" in the root level of the folder.  

The application will ask a series of questions about each employee.  Enter the corresponding information, and all the details will be automatically saved.  After you have finished entering your last employee, a web page will automatically be generated.  

You can view the final webpage by navigating to index.html in the 'dist' folder, and opening it in a browser.

## Required software
Any terminal/command line application is adequate to use this program.  You must also install node.js on your computer to download the other dependencies and run the program in the terminal.
